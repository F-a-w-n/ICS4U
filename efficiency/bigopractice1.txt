1) efficiency is important for the sake of portable, single purpose devices such as alarm systems.
The more efficient the program is, the less hardware is required to make them, saving money.

2)a) O(n)
b) O(n^3)
c) O(n)
d) O(nlgn)

1) space efficiency is the amount of storage or RAM the program takes to run, this type of efficiency is important in portable and single-purpose devices like an mp3 player. This is because the less storage a program takes, the less storage is needed in the device.
2)a) O(n^2)
b) O(n^2)
c) O(n^2)
d) O(n) //tried to be O(nlogn)

batch 2:
1) space efficiency is the amount of storage or RAM the program takes to run, this type of efficiency is important in portable and single-purpose devices like an mp3 player. This is because the less storage a program takes, the less storage is needed in the device.

2) a) O(n)
b) O(1)
c) O(n^2)
d) O(n^2)

1) a)
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
  for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {
    System.out.println(i*j);
  }
}
b)
int repeet (n) {
  if (n<=1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n + repeet(n-1); 
  }
}
2) a) O(n^2)
b) O(lgn)
c) O(n)
d) O(n^2) 

batch 3:
1) space efficiency is the amount of storage or RAM that is taken up by a program.It is typically less important than time efficiency as most devices can easily have enough storage for a program, but time decreasing is always beneficial
2) a) O(n^3)
b) O(nlgn)
c) O(n)
d) O(lgn)

2) a) O(1)
b) O(n^2)
c) O(n)
d) O(nlgn) //really O(n)


batch 4:
a) O(1)
b) O(lgn)
C) O(n^2)
d) O(n)
e) O(n)
f) O(lgn)
g) O(n)
h) O(n^2)
